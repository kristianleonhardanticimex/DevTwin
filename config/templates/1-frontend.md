# Copilot Instructions: Frontend Best Practices

- Use modern frontend frameworks and libraries (e.g., React, Vue, Angular) for building user interfaces.
- Organize code by feature or domain for maintainability (e.g., `src/components/`, `src/features/`).
- Prefer functional components and hooks (if using React) for new code.
- Use TypeScript for type safety and improved Copilot suggestions.
- Follow accessibility (a11y) best practices: use semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, and test with screen readers.
- Use CSS-in-JS, CSS Modules, or utility-first CSS frameworks (e.g., Tailwind) for styling.
- Write unit and integration tests for all UI components.
- Use Copilot to scaffold components, but always review and refactor for clarity, accessibility, and performance.
- Document public components and props with JSDoc or TypeScript comments for better Copilot context.
- Keep dependencies up to date and remove unused packages regularly.
