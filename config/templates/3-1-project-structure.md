# Project Structure

Organize your .NET backend using a scalable, maintainable folder and solution structure. Recommended:

- **Domain**: Core business logic, entities, value objects, interfaces.
- **Application**: Use cases, DTOs, application services.
- **Infrastructure**: Data access, external services, implementations.
- **API**: Controllers, endpoints, presentation layer.

Follow Clean Architecture principles for separation of concerns and testability.
