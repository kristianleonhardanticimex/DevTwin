# Copilot Instructions: Conventional Commit Messages

- All commit messages must follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) standard.
- Use the following types at the start of your commit message:
  - `feat:` for a new feature
  - `fix:` for a bug fix
  - `docs:` for documentation only changes
  - `style:` for formatting, missing semicolons, etc.
  - `refactor:` for code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature
  - `perf:` for a code change that improves performance
  - `test:` for adding or correcting tests
- The format is: `<type>: <short description>`
- Example: `feat: add user authentication`
- Use Copilot to suggest commit messages, but always review for clarity and compliance.
