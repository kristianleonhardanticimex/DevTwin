# Inheritance and Composition

Use inheritance and composition for code reuse and flexibility.

- **Inheritance**: Share behavior via base classes. Use for "is-a" relationships.
- **Composition**: Combine objects for flexible behavior. Use for "has-a" or "uses-a" relationships.
- Prefer composition over inheritance for greater flexibility and testability.
