# SOLID Principles

Follow SOLID for maintainable, extensible OOP code.

- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each class should have one responsibility.
- **Open/Closed Principle**: Classes should be open for extension, closed for modification.
- **Liskov Substitution Principle**: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.
- **Interface Segregation Principle**: Prefer many small, specific interfaces.
- **Dependency Inversion Principle**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions.
