# Copilot Instructions: Changelog & Release Workflow

- For every version bump, update `docs/changelog.md` with:
  - The new version number
  - The release date (YYYY-MM-DD)
  - A summary of the changes in this release
- Each changelog entry should follow this format:
  ```
  ## [1.2.3] - 2025-05-17
  - Added feature X
  - Fixed bug Y
  - Improved performance of Z
  ```
- This changelog update must be part of the Copilot/AI-assisted workflow for every release or significant change.
- Use Copilot to draft changelog entries, but always review for accuracy and completeness.
