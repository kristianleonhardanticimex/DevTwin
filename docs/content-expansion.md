# DevTwin Copilot Instruction Builder â€“ Content Expansion Plan

This document collects proposed new categories, subcategories, and features for the Copilot Instruction Builder. All items are organized into three levels: Category, Subcategory, Feature. Cross-cutting or deeper relationships are expressed as dependencies in parentheses. Each item includes a short description.

    - Async/Await: Write asynchronous code using async/await for clarity and error handling.
    - Promises: Use Promises for managing asynchronous operations.
    - Type Safety with TypeScript: Add static typing to JavaScript for safer, more robust code.
    - JSDoc: Document code with JSDoc comments for better tooling and maintainability.
  - Frontend Frameworks (depends on: React, Angular, Vue)
    - React: Build user interfaces with React, a component-based library. (depends on: Core Language Features)
    - Angular: Develop applications using Angular, a full-featured framework. (depends on: Core Language Features)
    - Vue: Create reactive UIs with Vue, a progressive JavaScript framework. (depends on: Core Language Features)
  - UI Testing (depends on: Frontend Frameworks)

- **C# / .NET**
  - Project Structure
    - Clean Architecture: Organize code into layers for maintainability and testability.
    - Feature Folders: Group files by feature for modularity and clarity.
  - Dependency Injection
    - Use Built-in DI: Register and inject dependencies using .NET's built-in DI container.
    - Service Lifetimes: Choose correct lifetimes (Singleton, Scoped, Transient) for services.
  - Configuration & Secrets
    - appsettings.json: Store non-secret configuration in appsettings.json.
    - User Secrets: Use user-secrets for local development secrets.
    - Environment Variables: Override config with environment variables for different environments.
  - Logging & Monitoring
    - Serilog: Structured logging for .NET applications.
    - Health Checks: Implement readiness and liveness endpoints for monitoring.
    - Application Insights: Distributed tracing and monitoring in Azure.
  - Unit Testing
    - xUnit: Microsoft's recommended unit testing framework for .NET.
    - NUnit: Popular alternative unit testing framework for .NET.
    - MSTest: Built-in unit testing framework for .NET.
  - Other C#/.NET Features
    - ASP.NET Web API: Build RESTful APIs with ASP.NET Core.
    - Entity Framework Core: ORM for data access in .NET.
    - LINQ: Query collections and databases with LINQ.
    - Minimal APIs: Lightweight HTTP APIs in ASP.NET Core.
    - MediatR: In-process messaging and CQRS for .NET.
    - Background Services (IHostedService): Run background tasks in .NET apps.
    - Nullable Reference Types: Enable null-safety in C# code.

## Frontend
- **React**
  - Component Patterns
    - Functional Components: Use function-based components for simplicity and performance.
    - Component Composition: Build complex UIs by composing smaller components.
  - State & Data
    - Hooks: Manage state and side effects in React components.
    - Context API: Share state across the component tree.
    - React Query: Data fetching and caching for React apps.
    - Zustand / Redux Toolkit: State management libraries for React.
- **Angular**
  - Structure
    - NgModules: Organize Angular apps into cohesive blocks of functionality.
    - Angular CLI: Command-line tooling for Angular projects.
  - Patterns
    - Dependency Injection: Use Angular's DI system for modularity and testability.
    - RxJS Patterns: Reactive programming with RxJS in Angular.
- **Vue**
  - Structure
    - Composition API: Modern API for organizing Vue component logic.
    - Vuex: State management for Vue applications.
    - Vue Router: Routing for single-page Vue apps.

## UI Testing
- **General**
  - Playwright: End-to-end browser testing for any frontend.
  - Storybook: Develop and document UI components in isolation.
- **Framework-Specific**
  - Testing Library (React, Angular): User-centric component testing for React and Angular. (depends on: React, Angular)

## Git & Version Control
- **Commit Message Standards**
  - Conventional Commits: Use a standard format for commit messages to enable automation and clarity.
- **Versioning & Release Management**
  - Semantic Versioning: Use MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH versioning for all projects.
  - Changelog & Release Workflow: Maintain a changelog and update it for every release.
