# DevTwin Copilot Instruction Builder â€“ Content Expansion Plan

This document collects proposed new categories, subcategories, and features for the Copilot Instruction Builder. All items are organized into three levels: Category, Subcategory, Feature. Cross-cutting or deeper relationships are expressed as dependencies in parentheses. Each item includes a short description.

    - NgModules: Organize Angular apps into cohesive blocks of functionality.
    - Angular CLI: Command-line tooling for Angular projects.
    - Dependency Injection: Use Angular's DI system for modularity and testability.
    - RxJS Patterns: Reactive programming with RxJS in Angular.
  - Vue: Create reactive UIs with Vue, a progressive JavaScript framework. (depends on: Core Language Features)
    - Composition API: Modern API for organizing Vue component logic.
    - Vuex: State management for Vue applications.
    - Vue Router: Routing for single-page Vue apps.
  - UI Testing: Tools and libraries for testing UI components and applications. (depends on: React, Angular, Vue)
    - Playwright: End-to-end browser testing for modern web apps.
    - Testing Library (React, Angular): Test UI components in React or Angular with user-centric APIs. (depends on: React, Angular)
    - Storybook: Isolated UI component development and documentation.

- **C# / .NET**
  - Project Structure: Recommended folder and solution structure for scalable .NET backends.
    - Clean Architecture: Organize code into layers for maintainability and testability.
    - Feature Folders: Group files by feature for modularity and clarity.
  - Dependency Injection: Use built-in DI for services, repositories, and configuration.
    - Use Built-in DI: Register and inject dependencies using .NET's built-in DI container.
    - Service Lifetimes: Choose correct lifetimes (Singleton, Scoped, Transient) for services.
  - Configuration & Secrets: Best practices for appsettings, user secrets, and environment variables.
    - appsettings.json: Store non-secret configuration in appsettings.json.
    - User Secrets: Use user-secrets for local development secrets.
    - Environment Variables: Override config with environment variables for different environments.
  - Logging & Monitoring: Structured logging, telemetry, and health checks.
    - Serilog: Structured logging for .NET applications.
    - Health Checks: Implement readiness and liveness endpoints for monitoring.
    - Application Insights: Distributed tracing and monitoring in Azure.
