# DevTwin Copilot Instruction Builder â€“ Content Expansion Plan

This document collects proposed new categories, subcategories, and features for the Copilot Instruction Builder. All items are organized into three levels: Category, Subcategory, Feature. Cross-cutting or deeper relationships are expressed as dependencies in parentheses. Each item includes a short description.

## Programming Languages
- **JavaScript / TypeScript**: Modern JavaScript and TypeScript development.
    - ES Modules: Use ES module syntax for modular, maintainable code.
    - Async/Await: Write asynchronous code using async/await for clarity and error handling.
    - Promises: Use Promises for managing asynchronous operations.
    - Type Safety with TypeScript: Add static typing to JavaScript for safer, more robust code.
    - JSDoc: Document code with JSDoc comments for better tooling and maintainability.
    - React: Build user interfaces with React, a component-based library. (depends on: JavaScript / TypeScript)
    - Angular: Develop applications using Angular, a full-featured framework. (depends on: JavaScript / TypeScript)
    - Vue: Create reactive UIs with Vue, a progressive JavaScript framework. (depends on: JavaScript / TypeScript)
    - Playwright: End-to-end browser testing for modern web apps. (depends on: React, Angular, Vue)
    - Testing Library (React, Angular): Test UI components in React or Angular with user-centric APIs. (depends on: React, Angular)
    - Storybook: Isolated UI component development and documentation. (depends on: React, Angular, Vue)

- **C# / .NET**: Modern .NET and C# backend development.
    - Clean Architecture: Organize code into layers for maintainability and testability.
    - Feature Folders: Group files by feature for modularity and clarity.
    - Use Built-in DI: Register and inject dependencies using .NET's built-in DI container.
    - Service Lifetimes: Choose correct lifetimes (Singleton, Scoped, Transient) for services.
    - appsettings.json: Store non-secret configuration in appsettings.json.
    - User Secrets: Use user-secrets for local development secrets.
    - Environment Variables: Override config with environment variables for different environments.
    - Serilog: Structured logging for .NET applications.
    - Health Checks: Implement readiness and liveness endpoints for monitoring.
    - Application Insights: Distributed tracing and monitoring in Azure.
    - xUnit: Microsoft's recommended unit testing framework for .NET.
    - NUnit: Popular alternative unit testing framework for .NET.
    - MSTest: Built-in unit testing framework for .NET.
    - ASP.NET Web API: Build RESTful APIs with ASP.NET Core.
    - Entity Framework Core: ORM for data access in .NET.
    - LINQ: Query collections and databases with LINQ.
    - Minimal APIs: Lightweight HTTP APIs in ASP.NET Core.
    - MediatR: In-process messaging and CQRS for .NET.
    - Background Services (IHostedService): Run background tasks in .NET apps.
    - Nullable Reference Types: Enable null-safety in C# code.
